140 valid HTML colors have names a human can say out loud.

I [gathered them all up](https://github.com/ainsleymcgrath/named_html_colors_scraper) and converted them to a JavaScript object, thanks to [Oleksii Rudenko](https://github.com/orkon)'s [json-to-js](https://json-to-js.com/) tool.

This is a proof of concept for generating pairs of colors that are accessible (according to W3) and readable by humans.
